Final assignment:

I chose option 2, gathering data from education statistics and display visualizations by state.  I put the final product on a webpage which can be viewed <a href="https://rawgit.com/SocialWebApps/Debra-Lewis/master/Final_assignment/resources/presentingData.html">here</a> (the HTML file is also stored in the resources folder in this directory); the user selects which data to display, and the website shows a pie chart with national averages and the national state-by-state map showing deviations from the national average.<br/>
The notebook itself can be easily viewed <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SocialWebApps/Debra-Lewis/blob/master/Final_assignment/Final_assignment.ipynb">here</a> without having to download the ipnyb file (you won't be able to run it through that link, though.).<br/>
The state-by-state maps are set up so that a state is colored white if it is within range of the average (determined by 1 standard deviation); it is blue if the state's average is below that of the national average; and it is red if the state's average is above that of the national average.  A darker color means that the state's average is farther away from the national average (as determined by standard deviations).
