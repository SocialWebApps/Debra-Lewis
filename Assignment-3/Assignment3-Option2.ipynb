The first three are addressed by  respective domains of engineering, arts, and business, with the last one from any field of scientific/social/educational relevance. Thus our collaboration has involved faculty members from anthropology, architecture, arts, business, cognitive sciences, education, engineering, and urban planning, with the list expanding rapidly.
